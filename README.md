# Number-2-Word
Welcome to the Number2Word Converter GitHub repository! This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for converting numerical values into their corresponding word representations.
For example, it converts "123" into "one hundred twenty-three".

## How it works

The script takes a numerical input from the user and converts it into words. It supports numbers up to "billion" and beyond, providing the word representation for each position (e.g., ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, etc.).
